# NBAChampionPredictor
In this project, I have utilized ML Techniques to predict future NBA Champions(playoff performance) based on historical regular season data. I have web-scraped over 40 years of season-wise team records from Basketball Reference.
The model takes a regression approach to addressing the Champion Prediction problem by engineering features closely resembling the characteristic traits of an NBA Champion and ranked probable future NBA Champions with an NDCG score of 70%.
